## CTR Optimisation with the aid of Machine Learning

A lot of SEO Specialists still use sorting in Google Search Console to make decisions about which articles to optimize. As I read in an a very useful article (https://understandingdata.com/ctr-optimisation-with-machine-learning/), there is a better solution that can help you make more informed decisions.


There is still a lot of room for improvement in my work, as you can see by the conclusions written in the report (md file). The only downfall of my approach is 
the lack of extrapolation, which may be solved with the use of different models. At the moment, this methodology really helped me to decide which articles to improve for the websites I manage and I can say that as the author of the article says, this approach is by far better.
