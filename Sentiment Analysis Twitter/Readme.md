Datasource was not included due to Twitter's policies about data collection. 

The analysis combines data from 11 UK politicians and 2 UK political parties to analyze general sentiments
from 2019 to 01-01-2019 from 01-27-2020 (1st dataset) and from 01-28-2020 to 05-31-2020 (after COVID-19 outbreak in UK).

First of all, I wanted to predict general sentiment for the 2 datasets to make a comparison and understand what happened.
Then, I just moved my focus on the second dataset to apply Na√Øve Bayes to find a good way to label tweets as positive or negative.
At the end, I used LDA (unsupervised learning) to find the most common topics across the dataset, which confirmed my idea that 
health-related topics were the most prominent.

More to follow in the next update!
